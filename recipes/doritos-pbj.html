        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I'm sure we've all eaten a PB&J sandwich and a ham & cheese sandwich with Doritos as kids. Some of us may still eat them to this day. But what if we took it a step further and combined what makes the ham & cheese sandwich with Doritos great, which is the Doritos, and combined them with the PB&J sandwich? Well, one person dared to take that step and transcended humanity. And you can too!</p>
