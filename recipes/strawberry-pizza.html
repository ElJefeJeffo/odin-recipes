        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-pizza-crust-recipe/" target="_blank">For the Pizza Dough</a></h3>
            <li><p>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. If you don't have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in the next step.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger - if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray - just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it's doubled in size, remove from the oven.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. (If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.) Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</p></li>
            <li><p>When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what you're doing, cover it lightly for 5-10 minutes, then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on baker's peels dusted with cornmeal.</p></li>            
            <li><p>Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings.</p></li>

            <li><p>Prepare the pizza dough through step 6 from above, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C) as described in step 4.</p></li>
            <li><p>Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, sprinkle with basil, and add the sliced strawberries.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That's optional.</p></li>
            <li><p>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</p></li>

            <h3>The Lazy Method</h3>
            <li><p>Before your cheese pizza arrives, prepare by slicing the strawberries to your preferred thickness.</p></li>
            <li><p>When it arrives, toss the strawberry slices onto the pizza and eat up!</p></li>
