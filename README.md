Project: Recipes
The website I'm currently building will be a joke website. It will have three strange made up recipes of food images I've found.

I will demonstrate how to create a new repository, set up a basic boilerplate, how to us the image element, how to use anchor elements, how to use ordered and unordered lists, how to organize all the files and directories that makes up the website, how to stage and commit changes to the website with Git, and finally, how to upload the website to Github.
